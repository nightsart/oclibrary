# oc library
My (Night) and my husband (Dj)'s OCs, organized.
Some additional info and pictures of mine are available on my <a href="https://night-sart.carrd.co">VGen</a> (characters tab)
I've designed mine and hubby designed his, then I drew all of them (or most: lost souls filter > I only drew Daphne and Night's icons there.)
